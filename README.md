# Project5
Hi there,
This project is about a small app created in Android Studio.
It's a grocery app, where you can buy, rate, add review, search an item and much more.
As data source, I have used shared preferences.
The class organization is not very clean but I have done it this way because of personal reasons.
Even the code is not all explained,personal reasons,if anyone need any explanations about something, dont hesitate to contact me, and I will be more than happy to respond.
In this project can be found the use of recycler views, fragments, thread and much more.
Keep in mind that I am a fresh developer, this year I will be finishing my University studies, and dont judge me to hard :D.
Thank you!.
